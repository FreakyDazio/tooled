# Tooled

Small, tested, independant classes that can be used to help keep ruby code clean and simple by avoiding the over-use of `Hash` and making use of commonly ignored features such as implementing the arithmetic methods (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`).

I started this gem as I enjoy writting underlying classes and implementing many of the libraries I have enjoyed from other languages and tools.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tooled'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tooled

## Usage

Usage is as simple as installing the gem and then using the classes in your own code.

## Contributing

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
